# Finland Public Holidays Analysis

## Overview

This project investigates and analyzes the public holidays in Finland from 2000 to 2050. It focuses on identifying the number of "real off days" each yearâ€”days that are public holidays falling on weekdays and not overlapping with weekends. Additionally, the analysis highlights the best and worst years in terms of real off days.

## Key Features

- **Data Scope**: Covers public holidays in Finland from 2000 to 2050.
- **Weekend Adjustment**: Excludes holidays coinciding with weekends to determine real off days.
- **Yearly Insights**: Provides insights into the best and worst years based on the number of real off days.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Utilized the Python `holidays` library to fetch public holidays in Finland for the specified years. (https://github.com/vacanza/holidays/)

2. **Calculations**:
   - Identified the weekday for each public holiday.
   - Excluded holidays that fall on weekends.
   - Counted the remaining holidays to calculate real off days for each year.

3. **Analysis**:
   - Compared yearly data to identify trends.
   - Highlighted years with the maximum and minimum real off days.

## Results

- The project outputs a comprehensive list of public holidays with their respective classifications (weekday vs. weekend).
- Identifies the year with the most favorable distribution of public holidays for extended breaks.
- Highlights years with fewer opportunities for real off days.
